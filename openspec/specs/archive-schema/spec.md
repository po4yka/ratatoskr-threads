# archive-schema Specification

## Purpose

Defines the first-version PostgreSQL schema contract owned exclusively by `ratatoskr-threads` in the `threads_archive` schema: what exists after a fresh application, that application is idempotent and transactional, and that provenance vocabularies are enforced by the database rather than by caller discipline.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A fresh database receives the complete first-version schema
Applying the schema definition to a fresh database SHALL create the `threads_archive` schema containing, at minimum, the account, credential, post, post-relation, media, capture, capture-resolution, export-run, export-record, raw-object, tombstone, outbox-event, and inbox-event tables declared in `schema.sql`. The set of created relations SHALL exactly match the file — no relation outside it is created, none of them is missing.

#### Scenario: Fresh apply creates every declared table and nothing else
- **WHEN** the embedded schema definition is applied to a newly created empty database
- **THEN** querying the catalog lists exactly the tables declared in `schema.sql`, all within the `threads_archive` schema

### Requirement: Schema application is idempotent under a lock
Applying the schema definition to a database that already has it SHALL make no change, and two processes applying concurrently SHALL both succeed with the file applied exactly once. Application SHALL be transactional: a failure part-way leaves the database without any of the schema objects.

#### Scenario: Second apply is a no-op
- **WHEN** the schema definition is applied twice to the same database and a second fresh apply runs concurrently from another connection
- **THEN** both applications succeed, the table set is unchanged after the second apply, and no object was created twice

### Requirement: Provenance vocabularies are enforced closed
The capture records SHALL carry an acquisition-method column and a saved-authority column constrained by named CHECK constraints to their documented closed vocabularies (`official_api | share_extension | browser_extension | telegram_capture | data_export | legacy_import` for acquisition; `explicit_user_capture | export_observation | unknown` for authority). Inserting any other value SHALL be refused by the database. A capture MUST NOT be representable as authoritative native platform state: the vocabulary contains no such value.

#### Scenario: Unknown acquisition method is refused
- **WHEN** a row is inserted into a provenance-bearing table with an acquisition method outside the closed vocabulary
- **THEN** the insert fails with the named CHECK constraint

#### Scenario: Documented authority values are accepted
- **WHEN** rows are inserted using each documented saved-authority value, including `explicit_user_capture`
- **THEN** all inserts succeed

### Requirement: No foreign key crosses the schema boundary
The schema SHALL NOT contain a foreign key referencing or referenced from a table outside `threads_archive`; references to identifiers owned elsewhere are plain columns. Provider identity columns that must be unique SHALL carry uniqueness enforced at the database.

#### Scenario: Catalog shows zero cross-schema foreign keys
- **WHEN** the applied schema is inspected in the catalog
- **THEN** no foreign key on any `threads_archive` table references a table in another schema

### Requirement: Tests get disposable databases built from the same schema
The test harness SHALL create uniquely named databases from the same embedded schema definition used at startup, against a configurable test database URL defaulting to the documented local compose endpoint, and SHALL drop them deterministically afterwards. A missing test database server is a test failure, not a skip.

#### Scenario: Two tests get isolated databases
- **WHEN** the harness creates databases for two tests in one run
- **THEN** each test connects to its own database with the full schema present, writes there do not collide across tests, and both databases are dropped after cleanup
