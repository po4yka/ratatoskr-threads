//! Process boundary for Ratatoskr Threads Archive: the runtime lifecycle
//! facts and the loopback operator router.
//!
//! - [`RuntimeState`] — the facts readiness is computed from, written by the
//!   boot sequence and its prober, read by every readiness request.
//! - [`admin_router`] — liveness, readiness, metrics and version, on the
//!   operator listener only.
//!
//! Every admin response carries `Cache-Control: no-store`: a cached "ready"
//! is a routing decision made from stale data.
